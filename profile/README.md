# Open Wine Project

The Open Wine Project is a collection of data catalogs, ontologies, tools and more organized to support the Open Wine Intiative.

While the community, data and tools are all open source, the effort is intended to make commercial use cases more efficient and consistent so various participants can plan better, plant better, grow better and taste better!

We are actively seeking community engagement and contribution. Please email openwineproject@googlegroups.com for an invite to join the project.
